# Fake_News_Detection
This project is implemented through deep learning.

Firstly, I did one hot representation so that I can used it for word embedding.

After that I used both LSTM and bidirectional LSTM in this, for comparing the accuracy.

I got an accuracy of 90.7\% in LSTM and 90.6\% in bidirectional LSTM.
